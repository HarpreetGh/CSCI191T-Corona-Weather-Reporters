# The Study of Weather effects on COVID-19

## CSCI191T - Big Data Analytics Project

A team project consisting of 6 other team members conducting research of the weather effects on COVID-19 

Using datasets on COVID-19 mortality rate and weather aspects such as temperature, ozone levels, and humidity levels
with dates persisting through the pandemic, we present our method of analyzing weather effects with mortality rate to see if weather
can have an effect on COVID-19. We use exploratory, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analyses to discover information from
various angles on the effect of weather on COVID-19 and offer possible solutions to the pandemic. To present our findings, we present
information extracted from the datasets for mortality rate, ozone levels, and humidity levels through visualization of graphs. Our results
showed high COVID-19 mortality rate across latitude 40Â° with generally warm weather patterns.
